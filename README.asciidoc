== Introduction ==
Teaching the basics of Ansible through application deployment is the goal of this workshop.

The workshop starts off with a short presentation explaining what Ansible is and what's the motivation behind it.

After that an image is provided to have multiple virtual images which are used in the hands-on session that follows. This image is created with Ansible using the procedure in INSTALL.asciidoc.

You can find preparation instructions for attendees in instructions.asciidoc and the hands-on session is explained in workshop.asciidoc.
