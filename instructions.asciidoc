= Instructions to prepare for the Ansible workshop
:author: Dag WieÃ«rs <dag@wieers.com>


== Prerequisites
Before we can start you need 3 things:

 - A hypervisor like KVM, VirtualBox, VMware Player or VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop
 - A suitable VM image for your preferred hypervisor (QCOW2 and VMDK images are available)
 - Sufficient free disk space for 3 VMs (about 1.5G per virtual machine should do)

You can find the QCOW2 and VMDK images at: http://dag.wiee.rs/attic/ansible-workshop/


== Setting up your virtual machines
This document was only tested for the KVM and VirtualBox hypervisors, but it should work fine with other hypervisors provided that it supports either QCOW2 or VMDK images.

Please test for your hypervisor of choice and contribute instructions back !


=== KVM/Libvirt hypervisor (QCOW2)
Perform the following actions:

 - Copy the _vm-noname.qcow2_ to your default libvirt image directory, usually _/var/lib/libvirt/images/_
 - Open Libvirt's "Virtual Machine Manager" and connect to *localhost (QEMU)*
 - Right-click *localhost (QEMU)* and select *New*
 - Provide the following information for the new VM:
    * VM name: *vm-master*
    * Installation type: *Import existing disk image*
    * Existing storage path: *vm-noname.qcow2*
    * OS type: *Linux*
    * Version: *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6*
    * Memory (RAM) size: *512 MB*
    * CPUs: *1*
    * Network type: *Virtual network 'default': NAT*
 - Do not start this new VM yet !!
 - Clone this VM as *vm-web*
 - Clone this VM again as *vm-db*


=== VirtualBox hypervisor (VMDK)
Perform the following actions:

 - Copy the _vm-noname.vmdk_ to a location of your choice
 - Start the "VirtualBox Manager"
 - If not already available, create a Host-only Network *vboxnet0*:
    * Go to *File > Preferences > Network > Host-only Networks*
    * Click the *Add host-only network* button (network nic logo with plus sign)
    * You should now have a *vboxnet0* network
 - Click the *New* button to create a new VM:
    * VM name: *vm-master*
    * Type: *Linux*
    * Version: *Red Hat (32bit)*
    * Memory size: *512 MB*
    * Select *Use an existing virtual hard drive file*
    * Click the *Folder with up-arrow* button and select the VM image
  - Do not start this new VM yet !!
  - Clone this VM as *vm-web*
    * Select *Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards*
  - Clone this VM again as *vm-db*
    * Select *Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards*


=== Other hypervisors (VMDK)
Most hypervisors can import VMDK files, so please use the VMDK image.

Read the above instructions and try to perform them in a similar manner.

If you would like to contribute to this document for other hypervisors, talk to me after the workshop !


== Testing your new setup
When you start all three VMs now, they will all show up with a text-interface to change the hostname of each VM. The interface will also display each VM's IP address on your internal network.

Please change the hostname of each VM according to the VM name. This is not strictly necessary but will make things easier during the workshop.

Test if you can log on as root via SSH to *vm-master* by using its IP address. The root password is *root*

    $ ssh root@192.168.56.3
    root@192.168.56.3's password: 
    The authenticity of host '192.168.56.4 (192.168.56.3)' can't be established.

    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

    [root@vm-master ~]# 

If this worked, test if you can connect from *vm-master* to *vm-web* and *vm-db*. This should work without a password or passphrase prompt.

    [root@vm-master ~]# ssh 192.168.56.4

    [root@vm-master ~]# ssh 192.168.56.5

You can contact me at <dag@wieers.com> in case you have specific questions. If we cannot make it work beforehand, come to the workshop 30 minutes in advance and we will look into it together.
