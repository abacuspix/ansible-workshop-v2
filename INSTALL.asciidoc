== Setup ==
A virtual machine is provided. Log in using user `root` and password `root`. By default the IP address is 192.168.122.21. This is in the standard libvirtd default network.

The virtual machine is created using Ansible and KVM. Run `ansible-playbook -i hosts install.yml` to configure it. You require the +mkisofs+ tool to create a temporary boot ISO image for booting.
