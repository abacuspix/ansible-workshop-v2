Ansible Workshop v2 Installation instructions
=============================================

== Setup ==
A virtual machine is provided. Log in using user `root` and password `root`. By default the IP address is 192.168.122.21. This is in the standard libvirtd default network.

The virtual machine is created using Ansible. Run the `provision.yml` playbook to configure it. That playbook assumes the CentOS live installation image is available in `/var/lib/libvirt/images/` and a directory `/tmp/ks` is available through HTTP on port 8000. Use `$ python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer` to do that in an easy way.
